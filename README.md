## Vanitybech
Vanitybech is a tool that creates Bitcoin Segwit addresses that start with a specific pattern. For example using the patern "test" the following address and it's corresponding private key can be generated.
```
Private Key:   L3hQA4b58N9Ndx4VgGFrtYLNGGrpPVhMa1BtbPKVD48JUiQskXZk
Address:       bc1qtest4ryd8xz84kzu4xyt8yn06ak24dn6nm763p
```

Since Bitcoin addresses are not reversable the only way to do this is to generate as many random private keys as possible, and check if their address matches the pattern. This is done repeatedly until a matching pattern is found.

## Estimated Time
Guessing a private key with the chosen prefix has an element of luck to it. The following table depicts a rough estimate on what should  be expected on a Ryzen 3600 desktop processor using all of it's 12 threads. Your results may vary.

| Prefix      | Eta(Ryzen 3600)|
| ------------- | ---------- |
|bc1q0        	  | 20 ms           |
|bc1q00           | 20 ms           |
|bc1q000          | 150 ms          |

|bc1q000000       | 3 hours         |
|bc1q0000000      | 3 days          |
|bc1q00000000     | 100 days        |

|bc1q0000000000   | 350 years       |
|bc1q00000000000  | 10000 years     |

## Important Notes
When using this software double check the generated addresses using other implementations to make sure that everyting is working correctly. Do NOT send mainet coins unless you make sure that the generated address matches the coresponding private key. I would recommend this open source [tool](https://segwitaddress.org/bech32/). Also, please do not use the addresses shown in this readme file as you will (probably) get robbed.
